# waffle.io-sandbox
Repository to play around with waffle.io just to see how it works and what moves things from state to state.

This is the only file in the repository and I will use it to checkout the detailed workings of waffle.io.

I, Andy Johns, own this repository and I am a scrum master in Lexington, KY. I am running this test so that I can understand how waffle.io works with Github. Once I understand the workings better then I can help my team make a more informed decision about whether or not to use it.
